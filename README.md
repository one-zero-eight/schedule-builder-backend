## Table of contents

Did you know that GitHub supports table of
contents [by default](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-13-table-of-contents-support-in-markdown-files/) ðŸ¤”

## About Us

#### Project Goal

Our key goal is to simplify the process of schedule creation and correction for Innopolis University DoE.

#### Project Description

Schedule Builder is a Google Spreadsheets plugin. The plugin is opened in parallel with the schedule and launched to check
the table for conflicts. Upon successful fetching, the user receives a list of conflicts found by the plugin. To simplify
the navigation, conflicts may be **highlighted** (user's cursor is moved to the conflicting cell) and **ignored** (conflict is
hidden from the user's view). The user may repeat scanning until all conflicts are resolved.

## How to use?

To test our product, you may follow the deploy link to Google Spreadsheets table with deployed plugin in it. In the plugin, you will be firstly required to visit the special page
of InNoHassle and obtain your requests token. Paste the token in the special field
and click the schedule checking button. After collisions fetching, you may navigate through
them and take actions in the table.

   (check [settings.schema.yaml](settings.schema.yaml) for more info).
3. Install Docker with Docker Compose.
4. Build and run docker container: `docker compose up --build`.
